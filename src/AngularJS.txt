1.What is AngularJS?
AngularJS is open source javascript framework that is build web applications.it can be freely used, changed and sharedby any one.
*AngularJS developed by google.
*It is an excellent framework for building single phase applications and line of business applications.
/*Advantages of AngularJs*/
there are lot of javascript frameworks for building web applications.so,it is a genuine question,why to use AngularJs.
**Following are the advantages of ngularJS over other JavaScript frameworks:
.Dependency injection: Dependency injection specifies a design patern in which components are given their dependencies instead of hard coding them within
the component.

.Two way data binding: AngularJs creats a two way data-binding between the select element and the orderProp model.OrderPorp is then used as the input for 
the the oredrBy filter.

.Testing:Angular JS is designed in a way that we can test right from the start.so,it is very easy to test any of its component through unit testing and end-to-end
testing.

Model view controller: In Angular JS, it is very easy to develop application in a clean MVC way.you just have to split your application code into MVC component i.e
model,view and the controller.

.Directives, filters ,modules, routes etc.
                 
     ***************************************************Angular JS MVC Architecture*****************************************************
MVC stands for "model view Controller".It is a software design pattern for developing web applications. it is very popular because it isolates the Application logic from 
the user interface layer and supports separation of concern.
                                                
                                                            Event
                                                              |
                                                          Controller<---
                                                              |        |
                                                            View       |
                                                              |        |
                                                            Model<------  
  The MVC Pattern is made up of the following three parts:
 
1.Model: it is responsible for managing application data.it responds to the request from the view and to the instructions from controller to update itself.
 
2.View: it is responsible for displaying all data or only a portion of data to the users.it also specifies the data in a particular format triggered by 
the controller's decision to present the data. they are script-based template systems such as JSP, ASP , PHP and very easy to integrate with ajax technology.

3.Controller: It is responsible to controll the relation between models and views.it responds to user input and performs interactions on the data model objects.
The controller recieves input,validates it, and then performs business operations that modify the state of the data model.
